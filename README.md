# UAV-Antena-Pointer-ATS-
The antenna tracking system is designed using MATLAB code, where the initial coordinates of the UAV, (x0, y0, z0), and the initial orientation of the antenna, phi and theta, are set through user input. The motion of the UAV with respect to time is described by the following equations:
